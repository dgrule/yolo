What could go wrong, you only live once. Said every developer I know.

## Instructions

Take a look at the `js` folder in the top-level. It should have some JavaScript function in standalone files. Some work may have been written under an extreme lack of sleep.

Your mission is to fix the broken code and if you feel brave, add your own new functions.

Fixing the broken:

1. Check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info around what's expected.
1. Find the bad code.
1. Send a pull request with your fixes for the bad code.
1. Go through the pull request review phase.
1. Profit!

Adding new functions:

1. Check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info around what's expected.
1. Add your new function.
1. Send a pull request with your additions. Don't forget to add tests!
1. Go through the pull request review phase.
1. Profit even more!

## Testing changes

### Online

You can test your code fixes online starting with this [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/caabernathy/822ur38d/). It's pre-filled with some of the functions that currently exist in the `js` folder. Watchful eyes may notice some new functions that this repo doesn't have. At least for now.

### Locally

You could even run tests locally using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). See the [contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more instructions on setting this up.
